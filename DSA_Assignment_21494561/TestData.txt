In real life, airports are frequently represented with 3 letter codes, controlled by an organisation known as IATA.

For user input the system uses these three letter IATA Codes.
Some useful codes include:
PER - Perth International Airport
SYD - Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport
MEL - Melbourne International Airport
LHR - London Heathrow Airport
LGW - London Gatwick Airport
ATL - Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport

To run the code, compile and run RouteFinderMenu.java

To find the name of an airport from it's code type "aprt" followed 
    by the 3 letter IATA code.
To find the name of the airport with code PER input:
aprt PER
Which would then output:
PER: Perth International Airport

To find a route between two airports, type "rout", then the code of the airport you want to start at, then the code of the airport you want to go to, then the maximum number of flights, then wether you want the results sorted by distance(d) or layover count.
To find routes between Perth And London Heathrow, with a maximum of 2 layovers, sorted by distance, input:
rout PER LHR 2 d
Which will then output the 20 best routes, sorted from least distance to most, the first number being the rank of the route
Found 43 routes between Perth International Airport (PER) and London Heathrow Airport (LHR)

Alternatively, to sort the same routes by layover input:
rout PER LHR 2 l

Which will the output:
1: Length: 16141 km     Layovers: 1     Route: PER -> DXB -> LHR
2: Length: 16835 km     Layovers: 1     Route: PER -> SIN -> LHR
